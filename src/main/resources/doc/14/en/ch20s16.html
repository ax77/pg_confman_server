     This feature was designed to allow parameters not normally known to
     <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> to be added by add-on modules
     (such as procedural languages).  This allows extension modules to be
     configured in the standard ways.
    </p><p>
     Custom options have two-part names: an extension name, then a dot, then
     the parameter name proper, much like qualified names in SQL.  An example
     is <code class="literal">plpgsql.variable_conflict</code>.
    </p><p>
     Because custom options may need to be set in processes that have not
     loaded the relevant extension module, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
     will accept a setting for any two-part parameter name.  Such variables
     are treated as placeholders and have no function until the module that
     defines them is loaded. When an extension module is loaded, it will add
     its variable definitions, convert any placeholder values according to
     those definitions, and issue warnings for any unrecognized placeholders
     that begin with its extension name.
